As discussed in the [Elements Overview](/docs/elements), Enhance Elements are authored as pure functions, which enables us to expand (or render, if you prefer) your elements on the server for incredible performance and as a base for [progressive enhancement](/docs/patterns/progressive-enhancement).

This is powered by the `html` function, which is made available as a required parameter on each Enhance Element function.


## The `html` function

Enhanceâ€™s `html` function (which is [a JavaScript tag function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)) is responsible for two critical pieces of functionality: custom element expansion, and style and script transformations.

<doc-callout level="info">

The `html` function runs as part of Enhanceâ€™s server side execution. This means custom element expansions, style transforms, and script transforms are performed at request time, leading to improved performance and reducing [flashes of unstyled content (FOUC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content).

### Custom element expansion

Custom element expansion is a term that describes the process in which Enhance takes an HTML page and your custom elements as inputs, and returns a single â€˜expandedâ€™ HTML page as output.

To illustrate this via a simple example, consider a custom heading element:

<doc-code filename="app/elements/my-heading.mjs">

```javascript
export default function MyHeading ({ html }) {
  return html`<h1>Hello World!</h1>`
}
```

</doc-code>

If this heading component is used within a requested page, the `html` function will be run, and the expanded content will be returned within the containing HTML page.

This means that this input:

```html
<my-heading></my-heading>
<p>Welcome to my page!</p>
```

Will be returned as this output:

```html
<my-heading>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</my-heading>
<p>Welcome to my page!</p>
```

The content you pass to the `html` function can contain anything you can write in HTML â€” that is, any HTML element (including other instances of your own Enhance Elements), style tags, script tags, or any interpolated code that returns a string.

The `html` function also performs special handling on `<slot>` elements, allowing for advanced composition patterns.

### Style transformations

The `html` function handles a few transformations for `<style>` tags and their contents:

- `<style>` tags will be collected from all custom elements, deduplicated when necessary, and placed in the `<head>` of the page.
- `:host` selectors will be rewritten as custom elements selectors to maintain scoped styles.
- Other selectors will be prepended with the name of the custom element, again to maintain scoped styles.

Building off our previous example, letâ€™s add some styles to our custom heading element:

<doc-code filename="app/elements/my-heading.mjs">

```javascript
export default function MyHeading ({ html }) {
  return html`
    <style>
      :host {
        margin: 2rem auto;
      }

      h1 {
        font-weight: 900;
      }
    </style>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  `
}
```

</doc-code>

After the style transformations and element expansion are performed, the following HTML would be returned:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    my-heading {
      margin: 2rem auto;
    }

    my-heading h1 {
      font-weight: 900;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <my-heading>
    <h1>
      Hello World!
    </h1>
  </my-heading>
</body>
```

### Script transformations

Any `<script>` tags included in your custom elementâ€™s `html` function will be collected and placed at the end of the document `<body>` to reduce page load times.
